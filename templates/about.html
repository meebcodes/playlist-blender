            <p><b>PlaylistBlender</b> is a tool that uses the Spotify API to generate
            appealing gradient images from public Spotify playlists.
            These images will reflect the mood and feel of the playlist,
            and are even formatted so you can upload them as cover art!<br><br>
            To get started, <b>copy the URL</b> of a <b>public Spotify playlist</b>
            and enter it into the form. Then press <b>"Get blends"</b> to get your results!<br><br>

            <p>PlaylistBlender is a web app that allows you to generate gradient images
                that reflect the mood and feel of your Spotify playlists.<br><br>
                These images are generated from an algorithm that takes into account the
                averaged musical attributes of songs on your playlist and outputs an image
                with colors chosen based on those averages. For example, a playlist with lots
                of cheery, upbeat songs might generate a bright, highly-saturated image. A playlist
                with lots of chill piano tracks, on the other hand, might produce something
                more muted and soft.<br><br>
                All of these musical attributes are pulled from the Spotify API. PlaylistBlender
                doesn't need (or have) access to any part of your Spotify account, so don't worry--this app
                won't make any kinds of changes to the playlists you submit. (This is also why PlaylistBlender
                is currently limited to public playlists!)<br><br>
                To copy a link to a playlist, first navigate to that playlist in your mobile or desktop
                Spotify app. Then:
            </p>
            <h3>Mobile</h3>
            <p>Click the three dots at the top of the playlist.
            Then click <b>Share</b> > <b>Copy link</b>.</p>
            <h3>Desktop</h3>
            <p>Click the three dots at the top of the playlist.
            Then hover over <b>Share</b> and click <b>Copy link to playlist</b>.
            </p>
